// subsession (i.e., each audio or video 'substream'). In practice, this might
// be a class (or a chain of classes) that decodes and then renders the incoming
// audio or video. Or it might be a "FileSink", for outputting the received data
// into a file (as is done by the "openRTSP" application). In this example code,
// however, we define a simple 'dummy' sink that receives incoming data, but
// does nothing with it.
